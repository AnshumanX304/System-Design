# YAGNI Principle in Java

## Description
- YAGNI stands for "You Aren’t Gonna Need It".
- It means you should not implement functionality until it is actually required.
- Prevents wasted time and reduces unnecessary complexity.

## Invalid Code
- Adds extra unused methods (Excel report generation, email sending).
- Increases maintenance effort and potential bugs.
- Violates YAGNI by building for future needs that might never come.

## Valid Code
- Implements only the required functionality (PDF generation).
- Keeps code clean, focused, and easy to maintain.
- Additional features will be added only when a real need arises.
