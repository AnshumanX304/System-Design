Interface segregation principle-:

(only solid principle that applies to interfaces and not classes)

1> ISP allows us to unburden and break down hefty interfaces to multiple chunks and segregate them based 
on their functionalities.
2> This allows us to not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them.
3> You should prefer many client interfaces rather than one general interface and each interface should have a specific responsibility.


‍Benefits-:

• Reduces unnecessary dependencies.
• Simplifies implementation for specific use cases.
