OPEN/CLOSED PRINCIPLE-:

=> The code must be open to extension but closed for modification 
   This means that software entities(class, modules and fucntions) should be open for extension but closed 
   for modification, which means you should be able to extend the class behaviour without modifying it.

=> Benefits-:
    1> Prevent breaking the existing code
    2> Encourages reusable components
