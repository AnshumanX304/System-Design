Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

    Definition:
        A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should do only one thing.

    Purpose:
        Improves maintainability, readability, and testability.

    Example:
        A User class that both stores user data and sends emails → violates SRP.

        Split into:

            User → manages user data

            EmailService → handles sending emails

Benefits:

    Easier to modify code without breaking unrelated logic

    Cleaner separation of concerns

    Smaller, more focused classes


SRP in a nutshell:

    "Do one thing, and do it well."
