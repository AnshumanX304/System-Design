Dependency Inversion Principle-:

1>  The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a principle in object-oriented design 
    that states that High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. 
    Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. 
    Details should depend on abstractions.

    ->  This actually means that a class should not depend on another concrete class.
        because if this happens then both the classes will be tightly coupled and will be
        be very difficult to modify i.e we'll need to change the entire code of the depending class 
        to meet the new requirements.
        If it were an abstraction we could have swiftly created a new class without changing the current class 
        implementation and could have replaced the interface's intance (which was previously 
        spawned by other class) with a new class implementation.

    ->  In simpler terms, the DIP suggests that classes should rely on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes)
        rather than concrete implementations. This allows for more flexible and decoupled code, making it 
        easier to change implementations without affecting other parts of the codebase.
