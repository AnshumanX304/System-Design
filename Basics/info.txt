1. Basic Structure of a Java Program

    The main method is the entry point.

    public class name must match the filename (Running_java.java).

    A file must have a single public class only which will act as the entry point.

    Compilation: javac Running_java.java

    Running: java Running_java (no .class or .java in the command)

2. Java Rule: You can define multiple classes in one .java file, but…
    # Only one of them can be declared as public
    # The file must be named after that public class
    # All classes will be compiled, but only those with main() can be run directly

2. File Name vs Class Name

    Situation	                    Rule
    Class is public	                File name must match the class name
    Class is not public	            File name can be anything
    Multiple classes in one file	Only one can be public
    File has no main method	        Can compile, but cannot run directly


3. Can I Run Any Class Separately?

    Yes, if the class has a main() method.

4. Packages and Folders

    package Basics;
    File must be inside Basics/ folder
    Must be compiled and run from the parent folder 

5. Compilation  needed or not 

    Case	                    Compile Needed?	                Command
    Java 8 or below	            Yes	                            javac A.java then java A
    Java 11+ (no package)	    No	                            java A.java
    Java 11+ with package	    Yes	                            javac pkg/A.java, java pkg.A


6. How to Handle Same Class Names in Java (e.g., A.java and A.java)
    1. You cannot have two classes with the same name in the same package
        If both File1.java and File2.java define a class A inside the same package (e.g., package Basics;), then:
            Both will compile.
            The second compilation will overwrite the previous A.class.

    2. Use different packages to avoid conflict
        Place each A.java file in its own package (namespace), like:
        package Basics.one;
        package Basics.two;
