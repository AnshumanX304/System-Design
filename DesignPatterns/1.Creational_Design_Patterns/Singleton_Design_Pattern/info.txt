Singleton Design Pattern -:

1> Singleton Pattern allows us to create just one instance of a class.

2> It allows you to create only one instance of a class and ensures that all parts of your application use that same instance.

THE PROBLEM WITH MULTIPLE INSTANCE OF A CLASS -:

- When we create multiple instance of same class again and again we consume unnecessary memory 
- Creating multiple instances of same class that does same work makes no sense 
- Thats where we use Singlepattern comes in 
- It makes default constuctor private and create instance using another function 
  that checks if the instance is created or not if its created it return the already created one
  else it creates a new one.
