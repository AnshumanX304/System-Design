Prototype Design Pattern - 
---------------------------

1. Definition:
   The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying (cloning) existing objects, instead of creating them from scratch using constructors.

2. Intent:
   - To reduce the cost of creating complex objects repeatedly.
   - To avoid subclassing by letting you clone existing prototypes.
   - To provide flexibility in creating objects at runtime.

3. Key Idea:
   - Keep a prototype (an original object).
   - When a new object is needed, clone the prototype instead of instantiating a new one.

4. Participants:
   - Prototype (Interface or Abstract class defining clone())
   - ConcretePrototype (Implements the clone method)
   - Client (Uses the prototype to create new objects by cloning)

5. Benefits:
   - Speeds up object creation.
   - Avoids redundant initialization code.
   - Makes it easier to add/remove object types at runtime.
   - Reduces subclassing.

6. Example (Game Characters):
   - A default "Character" acts as the prototype.
   - When a new character is needed (e.g., Warrior, Mage), we clone the prototype and modify only the required attributes.

7. When to Use:
   - When object creation is expensive or complex.
   - When you want to avoid building objects from scratch repeatedly.
   - When you need to keep different variations of an object.

In summary:
Instead of creating objects using 'new', Prototype lets you clone an existing object and modify it. 
This makes object creation flexible, efficient, and consistent.
