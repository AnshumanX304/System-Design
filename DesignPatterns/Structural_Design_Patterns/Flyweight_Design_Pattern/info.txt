Flyweight Design Pattern - Summary
----------------------------------

1. Intent:
   - The Flyweight pattern is used to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.
   - It separates intrinsic state (shared) from extrinsic state (unique).

2. Key Concepts:
   - Intrinsic State:
     * Information that is independent of the object’s context.
     * Stored in the Flyweight object and shared across contexts.
     * Example: color, material, texture of an asteroid.

   - Extrinsic State:
     * Information that depends on the context, cannot be shared.
     * Passed in or stored outside the Flyweight.
     * Example: position and velocity of an asteroid.

3. Structure:
   - Flyweight: The shared object containing intrinsic state.
   - Context: Maintains extrinsic state and references a Flyweight.
   - Flyweight Factory: Creates and manages Flyweights, ensures reuse instead of duplicate creation.

4. When to Use:
   - When you have a large number of similar objects.
   - When object creation and memory usage are expensive.
   - When most object data can be made external and shared.

5. Benefits:
   - Reduced memory usage.
   - Better performance in systems with many repeated objects.

6. Trade-offs:
   - Increases complexity because you must manage extrinsic state separately.
   - Context must supply external data every time an operation is performed.

7. Example (Asteroids in a Game):
   - Flyweight: stores shared asteroid data (size, color, texture, material).
   - Context: stores unique asteroid data (position, velocity).
   - Factory: ensures only one flyweight per combination of intrinsic data.

8. Real-World Analogies:
   - Characters in a text editor: font, style shared (intrinsic), position different (extrinsic).
   - Trees in a forest in a game: species shared, location unique.

9. Summary:
   - Flyweight is about sharing immutable, reusable data across many objects.
   - Key is to balance what is intrinsic (shared) vs extrinsic (per-instance).
