Composite Design Pattern

1. Definition:
   The Composite Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows 
   clients to treat individual objects (leaves) and compositions of objects 
   (composites) uniformly. It is useful for representing part-whole hierarchies.

2. Intent:
   - To represent tree-like structures of objects.
   - To let clients use individual objects and groups of objects in the same way.

3. Key Components:
   - Component: Common interface for all objects in the composition (e.g., SmartComponent).
   - Leaf: Represents individual objects that do not contain other objects (e.g., AirConditioner, SmartLight).
   - Composite: Represents groups of components; can contain both leaves and other composites (e.g., CompositeSmartComponent).
   - Client: Interacts with objects through the Component interface (e.g., main class).

4. Characteristics / Nuances:
   - Uniformity: Same operations are applied to both single objects and composites.
   - Recursive composition: Composites can contain other composites, forming a tree.
   - Transparency vs Safety: Uniform interfaces increase transparency but may expose unnecessary operations on leaf objects.

5. Use Cases:
   - GUI frameworks: Components like buttons (Leaf) and panels (Composite).
   - File systems: Files (Leaf) and directories (Composite).
   - Organizations: Employees (Leaf) and departments (Composite).
   - Smart homes: Devices (Leaf) and rooms/floors/houses (Composite).

6. Advantages:
   - Simplifies client code by treating individuals and groups uniformly.
   - Flexible and scalable for hierarchical structures.
   - Easy to add new component types.

7. Disadvantages:
   - Can introduce unnecessary complexity if hierarchy is not required.
   - Can make it harder to enforce constraints (e.g., preventing invalid compositions).

Summary:
The Composite Design Pattern enables uniform treatment of both individual and 
composite objects, making it ideal for tree-like hierarchical structures where 
operations apply consistently at all levels.
