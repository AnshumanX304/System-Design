Virtual Proxy Pattern
---------------------

Definition:
The Virtual Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern where a proxy object controls access 
to a resource that is expensive to create. The proxy delays the creation and initialization 
of the real object until it is actually needed, enabling lazy loading and improving performance.

Components:
1. Subject (Interface):
   - Defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy.
   - Ensures Proxy can be used in place of the RealSubject.

2. RealSubject (Real Object):
   - The actual implementation of the Subject.
   - Represents the resource that is expensive to create or initialize.
   - Performs the core operations (e.g., loading, rendering, or heavy computation).

3. Proxy:
   - Implements the same interface as the RealSubject.
   - Maintains a reference to the RealSubject.
   - Controls access to the RealSubject, instantiating it lazily when needed.

4. Client:
   - Interacts with the Subject interface.
   - Can use Proxy or RealSubject interchangeably without being aware of which one it is using.

Key Use Case:
- Deferring creation of an expensive object until it is needed (lazy initialization).
- Examples: loading images in GUI applications, loading large datasets, or initializing remote connections.
