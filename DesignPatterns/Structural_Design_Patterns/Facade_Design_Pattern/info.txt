Facade Design Pattern -
-----------------------

1. Definition:
   - Structural design pattern that provides a simplified, unified interface
     to a complex subsystem.

2. Problem:
   - Complex systems require multiple classes/method calls in specific order.
   - Leads to tight coupling and messy client code.

3. Solution:
   - Introduce a Facade class as a single entry point.
   - Facade hides subsystem complexity and exposes only needed functionality.

4. Components:
   - Subsystem Classes: Actual complex classes (e.g., MusicPlayer, VideoPlayer).
   - Facade: Simplifies interaction (e.g., MediaFacade).
   - Client: Uses only the Facade (no direct subsystem calls).

5. Benefits:
   - Simplifies client usage.
   - Reduces coupling between client and subsystem.
   - Improves maintainability and flexibility.
   - Provides a single entry point to the system.

6. Example (Your Code):
   - MusicPlayer and VideoPlayer: Handle details.
   - MediaFacade: Provides simple "playmusic" or "playvideo".
   - Client: Just calls performAction("playmusic").

7. Real-World Examples:
   - OS Media Player (Play Video button triggers multiple operations).
   - Banking System (transferMoney() hides account checks, notifications).
   - Frameworks like Spring/Hibernate.

In short:
Use Facade when you want to hide complex subsystems behind a simple interface.
