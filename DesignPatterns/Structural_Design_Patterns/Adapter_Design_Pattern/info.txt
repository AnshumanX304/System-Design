Adapter Design Pattern -:
-------------------------

1. Definition:
   The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows 
   incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between 
   two different interfaces by converting one interface into another that 
   the client expects.

2. Intent:
   - To allow classes with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
   - To achieve reusability of existing classes without modifying their source code.

3. Key Components:
   - Target (Interface): The interface expected by the client (e.g., SmartDevice).
   - Adaptee: The existing class that needs to be adapted (e.g., Airconditioner, SmartLight).
   - Adapter: The class that implements the Target interface and translates 
     the requests from the client to the Adaptee (e.g., AirconditionerAdapter, SmartLightAdapter).
   - Client: The code that interacts with the Target interface (e.g., main method).

4. Types of Adapters:
   - Class Adapter: Uses inheritance to adapt one interface to another.
   - Object Adapter: Uses composition (has-a relationship) to adapt the interface.

5. Use Cases:
   - Integrating legacy code with new systems without rewriting existing code.
   - Connecting systems using third-party libraries that provide different interfaces.
   - Allowing incompatible APIs (e.g., converting a USB port to an HDMI port in hardware analogy).
   - Making two services or frameworks communicate seamlessly.

6. Example:
   Suppose we have devices like Airconditioner (works via Bluetooth) and SmartLight (works via Wi-Fi).
   Both need to be controlled via a unified interface (SmartDevice). Using adapters, 
   both devices can be turned on/off without the client needing to know their internal details.

7. Advantages:
   - Increases code reusability by adapting existing classes.
   - Promotes loose coupling between client and adaptee.
   - Makes it easy to add new types of adapters without changing client code.

8. Disadvantages:
   - Can add extra complexity if overused.
   - May result in a large number of small adapter classes.

9. Real-World Analogies:
   - Power plug adapter (converting a 2-pin plug to a 3-pin socket).
   - Card reader that acts as an adapter between memory cards and a laptop’s USB port.
   - HDMI to VGA converter.

Summary:
The Adapter Design Pattern is about creating a middle layer (adapter) that 
converts the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect, 
enabling integration and reusability of incompatible systems.
