Bridge Design Pattern -
-----------------------

Intent -
--------
    Decouple abstraction (high-level control) from implementation (low-level details) so that both can vary independently.

Structure -
-----------
    Abstraction (Car) defines high-level operations.
    Implementation (Engine) defines low-level operations.
    The abstraction holds a reference to the implementation (has-a).

Use Case -
----------
    When you want to combine different abstractions with different implementations without an explosion of subclasses.

Example -
---------
    Car types (Sedan, SUV, Hatchback) × Engine types (Diesel, Petrol, EV).

Strategy Pattern vs Bridge Pattern (based on intent) -
------------------------------------------------------
 
    Strategy-
    ---------
        Encapsulates algorithms or behaviors and lets you swap them at runtime. Focus is on flexibility of choosing behavior.
    Bridge-
    -------
        Separates abstraction from implementation so both can evolve independently. 
        Focus is on avoiding subclass explosion.(cannot swap implementation in between)
