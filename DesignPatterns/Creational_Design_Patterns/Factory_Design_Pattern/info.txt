Factory Pattern - Detailed Description
---------------------------------------

1. Overview
-----------
The Factory Pattern is a **creational design pattern** that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. 
It encapsulates the object creation logic, promoting loose coupling between client code and the concrete classes it needs to instantiate.

2. Purpose
----------
- To centralize object creation logic.
- To avoid exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
- To make the system more scalable and maintainable when introducing new object types.

3. Key Idea
-----------
Instead of calling a constructor directly (using `new`), the client calls a factory method.
The factory method decides which subclass or specific implementation to return based on parameters or internal logic.

4. Advantages
-------------
- Promotes loose coupling between client and product classes.
- Makes it easy to introduce new types without modifying existing client code.
- Centralizes creation logic for easier maintenance.

5. When to Use
--------------
- When the exact type of object to create is determined at runtime.
- When the creation process is complex or involves multiple steps.
- When you want to decouple client code from the concrete classes it uses.
