Builder Design Pattern - Summary
================================

Definition:
-----------
The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step-by-step.
It separates the object creation process from its final representation.

Purpose:
--------
- To avoid telescoping constructors (constructors with many parameters).
- To make object creation readable and flexible.
- To allow creating different variations of an object with the same construction process.

Key Elements:
-------------
1. **Product** - The object being built.
2. **Builder** - Defines methods for configuring the product.
3. **ConcreteBuilder** - Implements builder methods and returns the product.
4. **Client** - Uses the builder to create objects.

Advantages:
-----------
- Improves code readability and maintainability.
- Allows step-by-step object creation.
- Makes it easy to create immutable objects.

Typical Usage:
--------------
- When an object has many optional parameters.
- When object creation involves multiple steps.
