Mediator Design Pattern - Core Concept

1. Problem it Solves:
   - Many objects need to communicate with each other.
   - Direct communication creates a web of dependencies (spaghetti code).
   - Hard to maintain, extend, or modify.

2. Core Concept:
   - Introduces a central object (Mediator) that handles communication.
   - Colleagues (objects) don’t talk to each other directly, only to the Mediator.
   - Mediator decides how requests/messages are routed.

3. Structure:
   - Mediator (interface/abstract class): declares communication methods.
   - Concrete Mediator: implements coordination logic between colleagues.
   - Colleagues: objects that reference the mediator and communicate only through it.

4. Example (Auction System):
   - Mediator = AuctionHouse
   - Colleagues = Bidders
   - Bidder places a bid → informs AuctionHouse → AuctionHouse notifies other bidders.

5. Key Benefits:
   - Reduces coupling: colleagues know only the mediator, not each other.
   - Centralized control: easy to change communication rules.
   - Flexibility: add/remove colleagues without affecting others.

6. Trade-offs:
   - Mediator can become very complex (God object) if it takes too much logic.

7. One-liner Definition:
   - The Mediator Pattern centralizes communication between objects, so they don’t need to know about each other, only the mediator.
