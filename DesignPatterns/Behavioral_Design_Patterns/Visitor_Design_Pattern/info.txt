Visitor Design Pattern
======================

Short Description
-----------------
The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms (operations) from the objects on which they operate. It allows adding new operations without modifying the object structure.

Key Components
--------------
1. Element (Patient in example)
   - An interface or abstract class with an `accept(Visitor visitor)` method.  
   - Concrete implementations: `ChildPatient`, `AdultPatient`, `SeniorPatient`.  

2. Visitor Interface
   - Declares visit methods for each type of element (e.g., `visit(ChildPatient)`).  

3. Concrete Visitors
   - Implement the operations for different element types.  
   - Example: `DiagnosisVisitor`, `BillingVisitor`.  

4. Client
   - Creates elements and visitors.  
   - Makes each element accept different visitors to apply operations.

When to Use
-----------
- When you need to perform multiple, unrelated operations on objects without polluting their classes with those operations.  
- When the object structure is stable but operations on them are expected to change or grow.  
- Common use cases:  
  - Compilers (different passes like type checking, optimization, code generation)  
  - Hospital management (diagnosis, billing, record-keeping for patients)  
  - Object structure traversal (like applying actions on nodes of a tree).
