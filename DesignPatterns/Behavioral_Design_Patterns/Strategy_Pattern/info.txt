Strategy Design Pattern - 

Definition:
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms (strategies),
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The client can switch between different algorithms
at runtime without modifying the context class.

When to Use:
- When you have multiple algorithms/behaviors for a task (e.g., different payment methods).
- When you want to switch algorithms dynamically at runtime.
- When you want to avoid long if-else or switch-case statements.
- When you want to follow the Open/Closed Principle (add new strategies without changing existing code).
- When you want to reduce code duplication and keep algorithms isolated.

When NOT to Use:
- When there is only one fixed algorithm.
- When algorithms never change at runtime.
- When introducing strategy classes will overcomplicate the design.

Advantages:
- Promotes flexibility by allowing behavior to be selected at runtime.
- Follows Open/Closed Principle (easy to add new strategies).
- Reduces code duplication.
- Makes code cleaner by removing conditional statements.

Disadvantages:
- Increases the number of classes in the system.
- The client must be aware of different strategies to choose the right one.

Real-World Examples:
- Payment processing (CreditCard, DebitCard, Crypto, UPI).
- Compression algorithms (ZIP, RAR, TAR).
- Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort).
- Travel navigation routes (Car, Bike, Walk).
- Authentication strategies (OAuth, JWT, SAML).

Summary:
Use Strategy Pattern when you need different interchangeable behaviors for the same task,
and you want to switch between them dynamically without cluttering the code with conditionals.
