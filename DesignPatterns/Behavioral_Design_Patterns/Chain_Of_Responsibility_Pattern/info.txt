Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern -
----------------------------------------

Definition:
The Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. 
Each handler in the chain either processes the request or forwards it to the next handler.

Key Components:
1. Handler (Abstract class or interface)
   - Declares a method for handling requests.
   - Maintains a reference to the next handler.

2. Concrete Handlers (e.g., TeamLead, Manager, Director)
   - Decide whether to handle the request.
   - If unable, pass the request to the next handler in the chain.

3. Client
   - Initiates the request and sends it to the first handler in the chain.

Advantages:
- Decouples sender and receiver.
- Eliminates long if-else or switch-case blocks.
- Flexible: easy to add, remove, or reorder handlers.

Example:
Leave approval system where requests move from TeamLead -> Manager -> Director.

Difference from State Design Pattern:

1. Chain of Responsibility:
   - Focus: "Who will handle this request?"
   - Multiple handlers, but typically only one processes the request.
   - Used for request delegation.

2. State Pattern:
   - Focus: "How should the object behave right now?"
   - Same object behaves differently based on its internal state.
   - Used for state-dependent behavior.

Summary:
- Chain of Responsibility = Request is passed along a chain until someone handles it.
- State = An object’s behavior changes when its internal state changes.
