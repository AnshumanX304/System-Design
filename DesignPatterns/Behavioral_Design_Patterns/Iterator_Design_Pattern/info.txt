Iterator Design Pattern -:
-----------------------

Definition:
The Iterator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a standard way to sequentially access elements 
of a collection (list, array, set, etc.) without exposing its internal representation.

Key Components:
---------------

1. Aggregate (Collection) – The object that holds elements (e.g., Playlist).
2. Iterator Interface – Defines the methods for traversal, usually hasNext() and next() (e.g., PlaylistIterator).
3. Concrete Iterators – Implement different traversal strategies (e.g., NormalPlaylistIterator, ShuffledPlaylistIterator).
4. Client – Uses the iterator to traverse without depending on the collection’s structure.

When to Use Iterator Pattern:
-----------------------------

- When you want to traverse a collection without exposing its underlying data structure (like ArrayList, HashMap, custom trees, etc.).
- When you need multiple ways of traversing the same collection (e.g., forward, backward, shuffled, filtered).
- When you want to provide a uniform traversal interface for different types of collections.
- When you want to separate traversal logic from collection logic, keeping the code clean.

When NOT to Use Iterator Pattern:
---------------------------------

- If your collection is very simple (like a small array) and extra abstraction only adds unnecessary complexity.
- When performance is critical, and creating iterators or copying collections may add overhead.
- If you don’t need multiple traversal strategies, and direct access (e.g., using for-each) is sufficient.
- When exposing the internal structure does not harm encapsulation in your specific case.

Real-World Examples:
--------------------
- Iterating over a list of YouTube videos, either normally, shuffled, or based on favorites.
- Iterating over a menu in a restaurant system, where items may be traversed differently (veg-only, non-veg-only, or all items).
- Java’s built-in Iterator and Iterable interfaces in the Collections Framework are real implementations of this pattern.

⚡ In short:
-----------

Use the Iterator Pattern when you need flexibility, multiple traversal strategies, or encapsulation of the collection’s structure.
Avoid it when you only need simple, direct iteration and don’t want extra boilerplate.
