Observer Design Pattern
-----------------------

Definition:
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the Subject) 
changes state, all its dependents (Observers) are notified and updated automatically.

Key Components:
1. Subject (Publisher):
   - Maintains a list of observers.
   - Provides methods to attach/detach observers.
   - Notifies all observers when its state changes.

2. Observer (Subscriber):
   - Defines an interface with an update() method.
   - Gets notified by the Subject when a change occurs.
   - Reacts accordingly.

3. Concrete Subject:
   - Implements the Subject interface.
   - Holds state and triggers notifications.

4. Concrete Observer:
   - Implements the Observer interface.
   - Defines a specific reaction to updates from the Subject.

When to Use:
- When multiple objects need to be notified automatically of changes in another object.
- To achieve loose coupling between objects (Subject does not need to know details of Observers).
- When you have an event-driven system (e.g., GUI listeners, notification systems).
- Common examples: Publish/Subscribe systems, GUI frameworks, event handling, messaging systems.

Advantages:
- Promotes loose coupling between Subject and Observers.
- Supports broadcast communication (one Subject to many Observers).
- Easy to add new observers without modifying existing code.

Drawbacks:
- Can lead to unexpected updates if there are too many observers.
- Risk of memory leaks if observers are not properly removed.

Example:
- A YouTube Channel (Subject) notifies its Subscribers (Observers) whenever a new video is uploaded.
